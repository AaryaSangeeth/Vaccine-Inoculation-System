# Vaccine-Inoculation-System
The vaccine inoculation system is designed and tailored in order to  streamline the process of managing patient records, scheduling appointments, and tracking vaccine stocks in a clinic. The system is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles so as to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. 

It primarily addresses real-world challenges such as maintaining patient registration, tracking vaccine administration, and vaccine inventory management, making it a practical tool that can be further scaled and developed for healthcare providers. 


The system is divided into four main components: Patient Management, Admin Module, Staff Module, and Vaccine Management, each implemented using OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and class friendship


## Project Overview

- **Language**: C++
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **User Roles**:
  - **Admin**: Manages appointments and vaccine stock.
  - **Staff**: Administers vaccines and updates patient records.
  - **Patient**: Registers, views appointment and vaccination status.
- **Data Storage**: CSV files for patients and appointments.
- **Vaccine stock**: Tracked using an in-memory static map.



## How to Compile and Run

### Compiling 

Using g++:
g++ src/user.cpp -o user

### Executing 

Run the executable : 
./user ( make sure you're in the root folder src when running the executable)
