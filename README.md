# Vaccine-Inoculation-System
The vaccine inoculation system is designed and tailored in order to  streamline the process of managing patient records, scheduling appointments, and tracking vaccine stocks in a clinic. The system is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles so as to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. 


The system is divided into four main components: Patient Management, Admin Module, Staff Module, and Vaccine Management, each implemented using OOP concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and class friendship
