### Files:

- `patient_data.txt`: Stores patient registration details, including Emirates ID, name, and vaccine status.
- `vaccine_log.txt`: Records vaccination history logged by staff.
- `admin_config.txt`: (Optional) Stores hashed admin password or system settings.

### Data Handling:

- The files are updated automatically based on actions performed by each user type:
  - **Patients** add their data during registration.
  - **Staff** can update vaccination records.
  - **Admins** may reset or export data.
- All file I/O uses basic C++ file streams (`fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`).
